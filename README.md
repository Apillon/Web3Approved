# The Web3Approved initiative

Practise what you preach, host your website on an unstoppable Web3 hosting, powered by IPFS. 

Web3Approved represents an initiative aimed to promote the decentralization of operations within the Web3 ecosystem. We believe decentralized hosting is a crucial first step on the journey to the wider adoption of Web3 technologies. To jumpstart the movement, our initiative offers IPFS hosting services for projects to host their websites - completely free of charge.

# Why should you host or backup your website on Web3? 
Hosting your website or app on a decentralized network of globally scattered nodes makes it unstoppable and defiant against single-point-of-access censorship.

# How does it work?
### IPFS
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed system for peer-to-peer access and transfer of files, websites, apps, and data. When you upload a file to IPFS, it gets split into smaller chunks and cryptographically hashed. It also receives a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID), which acts as a permanent record of your file as it is at that point in time.

### Crust Network
Crust Network is a decentralized cloud storage provider on Polkadot. It supports multiple storage-layer protocols, such as IPFS, and delivers instantly accessible on-chain storage functions. Crustʼs technical stack also supports data manipulation and computing.

### Apillon Storage buckets
Decentralized hosting of a website or an app on Apillon is very similar to using storage buckets, a more dynamic way of managing file storage on Web3. It takes advantage of the underlying Crust Network and IPFS protocol to host your Web3 website or application.
